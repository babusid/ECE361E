In order to replicate our results, follow the following instructions.

1) Train the model for 350 epochs with a batch size of 128. Main pt is setup to train the correct model
2) The model will checkpoint itself every epoch in a new folder called "ckpt". It will also output a .txt and a .csv with some training metrics. We have included the final checkpoint from our training run.
3) Run the torch_to_onnx script. This will convert the torch model to an onnx model. 
4) Run the quantize onnx script with the argument "onnx_model" (no prepended --) and the filepath to the onnx model generated by torch_to_onnx. This will generate two new onnx models, one suffixed with _infer and one suffixed with _int8. 
We have included the one we used for deployment (the int8). 
5) Deploy this onnx on the raspberry pi using the included deploy_onnx.py file. You will have to use the args "--model" and "--target" with the values of the onnx filepath and "rpi" respectively.
It will generate an output testmetrics txt file in the same directory as the onnx provided to it.

OUR FINAL MODEL IS "mobilenetv2_19_2_stem_5_int8.onnx"
